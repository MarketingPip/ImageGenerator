# OG Image Generator ðŸ“¸

This is a Serverless OG Image Generator. It's meant to work with Netlify Functions, but should work on any serverless platform you're using.

The image generator uses HTML templates, renders them using Puppeteer, and then takes a screenshot that can be returned back to the user as a response. You should be able to scale this relatively easily as images are generated per-request, and can likely use cache-control headers to ensure efficient operation.
